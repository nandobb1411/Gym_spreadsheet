- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17q7W33-SHAv9GhhnHPQYUx2VEXvYKlXtOpPtC8laJww/edit?usp=sharing
## Project Description

So, Basically I was having issues with managing my diet and exercises on the gym, so I created this spreadsheet. This spreadsheet is designed to help individuals manage their daily caloric intake and plan their weekly exercise routine, the design is not the best, but im improving it still, and it's functional haha. Some of the features are yet to be implemented, but this readme file should guide me through the proccesss. It includes the following features:
- (In order to get the max out of this, use the google sheets link and clone the page for your usage)

- A log for recording daily food intake, including the name of the food, portion size, and calorie count
- A list of common exercises, organized by muscle group, with the corresponding number of calories burned per hour
- A list of calistenic exercises and a spot to put your progression in each exercise
- A weekly exercise planner, which recommends specific exercises to be performed on each day of the week based on the muscle groups to be targeted
- The daily caloric consumption you must follow base on the BLR formula


## Benefits

- Allows users to easily track and monitor their caloric intake
- Helps users create and follow a balanced exercise plan
- Facilitates the achievement of weight loss or muscle gain goals

## Technologies Used

- Spreadsheet software (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets)
- Formulas and functions for data manipulation and analysis

## Key Challenges

- Ensuring the accuracy of the calorie and exercise data
- Designing a user-friendly interface for easy data entry and analysis
- Testing and debugging the spreadsheet to ensure proper functioning

## Future Improvements

- Integration with fitness tracking devices or apps to automatically log exercise data
- Customization options for target calorie intake and exercise frequency based on individual goals and needs
- Expansion of exercise and food databases for more comprehensive tracking and planning.
